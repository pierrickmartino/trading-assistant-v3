# Scope Document for AI Agent: PolygonScan Asset Tracking

## Overview
This document outlines the scope for developing an AI agent capable of tracking the assets of a specified address using the PolygonScan API. The purpose of this agent is to facilitate asset management and provide users with a comprehensive view of their cryptocurrency holdings on the Polygon network.

### 1. API Endpoints
To track assets, the AI agent will leverage the following endpoints from the PolygonScan API:

- **Accounts**
  - **`GET /api?module=account&action=balance`** - Retrieves the balance of Ether for a given address.
  - **`GET /api?module=account&action=tokentx`** - Fetches token transaction history for an address.
  - **`GET /api?module=account&action=tokenbalance`** - Provides the balance of a specific token for an address.

- **Tokens**
  - **`GET /api?module=token&action=getTokenInfo`** - Retrieves information about a given token using its contract address.
  - **`GET /api?module=token&action=tokenList`** - Lists tokens available on the Polygon network.

- **Stats**
  - **`GET /api?module=stats&action=topaccounts`** - Retrieves the top accounts on the network, which can provide context for asset holdings.

### 2. Limitations
Understanding the limitations of the PolygonScan API is essential for proper implementation:

- **Rate Limiting**: The API has rate limits (commonly 5 requests per second for free accounts) which may impact how frequently data can be fetched. Exceeding this limit will result in error messages or failed requests.
  
- **API Quotas**: Free-tier accounts have restricted access to certain endpoints or limited usage; advanced features require a Pro account.

- **Data Availability**: The API may not provide historical data for all assets, particularly new tokens that were only recently deployed.

- **Latency**: The response time for API calls can vary, and the asynchronous nature of network calls may lead to performance bottlenecks if not handled correctly.

### 3. Optimization
To ensure efficient operation of the agent, consider the following optimizations:

- **Batch Requests**: Utilize batch processing for fetching data where multiple queries can be combined to reduce the number of requests made.
  
- **Caching**: Implement local caching of results to minimize redundant API calls, especially for data that doesn't change frequently.

- **Asynchronous Processing**: Use async programming techniques to handle multiple requests concurrently without blocking, thus ensuring faster data retrieval.

- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling and retry logic to manage rate limiting or temporary network issues.

### 4. Asset Calculation
To calculate a user's total assets, the following steps should be performed:

1. **Fetch Ethereum Balance**: Use the `balance` endpoint to get the Ether balance of the address.
  
2. **Fetch Token Balances**: 
   - First, retrieve all token transactions using `tokentx` to identify all the tokens associated with the address.
   - For each unique token instance, call the `tokenbalance` endpoint to get the current balance.

3. **Aggregate Values**: 
   - Sum the values of all tokens and the Ether balance to calculate the total asset value.
   - Optionally, convert token values into a common currency (e.g., USD) using an average price feed from an external API, if needed.
