# Wallet Address Tracker Scope Document

## 1. Overview
The Wallet Address Tracker is designed to retrieve and display the balance of a specific wallet in the Polygon network, particularly focusing on the POL token and other contract addresses. It filters out any addresses with a balance equal to zero, providing a concise summary of the user's assets.

## 2. API Endpoints

### 2.1. Account Balance Endpoint
- **Endpoint**: `https://api.polygonscan.com/api`
- **Parameters**:
  - `module`: `account`
  - `action`: `balance`
  - `address`: *(string)* The wallet address to query.
  - `tag`: *(string)* Use "latest" for the most recent balance.
  - `apikey`: *(string)* Your PolygonScan API key.

- **Example Request**:
  ```
  https://api.polygonscan.com/api?module=account&action=balance&address=0xYourWalletAddress&tag=latest&apikey=YourAPIKey
  ```

- **Response JSON Format**:
  ```json
  {
    "status": "1",
    "message": "OK",
    "result": "1000000000000000000"  // Balance in Wei
  }
  ```

### 2.2. Token Balances Endpoint
- **Endpoint**: `https://api.polygonscan.com/api`
- **Parameters**:
  - `module`: `account`
  - `action`: `tokenlist`
  - `address`: *(string)* The wallet address to query.
  - `apikey`: *(string)* Your PolygonScan API key.

- **Example Request**:
  ```
  https://api.polygonscan.com/api?module=account&action=tokenlist&address=0xYourWalletAddress&apikey=YourAPIKey
  ```

- **Response JSON Format**:
  ```json
  {
    "status": "1",
    "message": "OK",
    "result": [
      {
        "tokenAddress": "0xTokenAddress1",
        "tokenName": "TokenName1",
        "tokenSymbol": "TKN1",
        "balance": "0" // This balance will be ignored in final results
      },
      {
        "tokenAddress": "0xTokenAddress2",
        "tokenName": "TokenName2",
        "tokenSymbol": "TKN2",
        "balance": "5000000000000000000" // Only non-zero balances will be shown
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

## 3. Limitations of APIs
- **Rate Limits**: The API may be subject to usage limits (typically 5 requests per second for public endpoints).
- **Response Time**: Latency may occur due to network issues or API load.
- **Data Accuracy**: The API may not always reflect real-time data due to network delays or pending transactions.

---

## 4. Optimization for Better Performance
- **Caching Requests**: Implement caching for repeated requests to reduce API calls.
- **Batch Requests**: If multiple wallet addresses need to be checked, consider batching requests where possible.
- **Error Handling**: Implement retries for failures due to temporary issues.

---

## 5. Asset Calculation and Aggregation
1. Retrieve POL balance using the balance endpoint.
2. Retrieve all token balances using the tokenlist endpoint.
3. Filter out all tokens with a balance of zero.
4. Aggregate results to provide a concise list of assets and their balances.

### Example Data Aggregation Flow
- For the POL balance, convert Wei to the standard decimal format.
- For other tokens, ensure the displayed balance aligns with the token's decimal configuration (if applicable).

---

## 6. Possible Next Steps
- Implement a UI for an easy user experience.
- Consider enabling alerts for significant balance changes.
- Develop a feature to track historical balances over time.
- Explore additional integration options for more comprehensive transaction tracking.
