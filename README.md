# My Crypto Prices

## Overview
This project retrieves historical cryptocurrency prices from CryptoCompare and stores them in a TimeScaleDB instance. 
The application uses [PydanticAI](https://ai.pydantic.dev/) to create an Agent that coordinates the logic:
1. Checks if a daily price is already stored in the DB.
2. If not, queries the CryptoCompare API for that dayâ€™s price.
3. Stores/retrieves the data from TimeScaleDB.
